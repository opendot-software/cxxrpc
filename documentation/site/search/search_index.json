Runtime for Parallelism & Concurrency A specification for high performance computing and highly responsive applications. Software Components OS Level Thread Control Library This will be the lowest layer in the entire stack of software Will be used to spawn threads, enable/disable hyperthreading, controll thread to core mapping, potentially control thread local memory allocation using NUMA concepts Abstraction for TCL (Thread Control Library) This will expose user friendly APIs to spawn the threads with custom configurations Thread & Data Management Layer It will store all running threads Will control their eager/lazy execution Will handle the work queue for each thread Will expose APIs to submit work and access state of execution Data Partition Schemes Will allow users to specify the way data is split chunk size, number of chunks Partition Scheduling Schemes How each chunk/partition is mapped to each underlying OS level thread Questions Where does task come into the picture What is the differ or similarity bw partition and chunk Define a standard naming system Will this framework only for for Data Parallel Computational purposes? Can this system be used to expose a user friendly API to define software level pipelines?
